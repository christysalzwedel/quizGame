# quizGame
A quiz game that reads an easily created formatted file and produces a quiz fitting user specifications. (and makes fun of you if you're wrong a lot.) Great for fun quiz questions, but could easily be a study aid since users can make question files very easily.

This code began its life as an assignment, but it just blandly offered questions and tallied results.
Not a great user experience, even if it makes a reasonable coding challenge. 
I decided to fix it, and have been improving it ever since. 
Quiz questions are kept in a text file in pipe delimited lines, and the address of the file is user input, so creating new quiz files is very easy.
When complete a file of any number of lines can be used, and users will be able to set the number of questions returned, select the difficulty and topics,
and then recieve the correct number and type of questions in a random order.
